# 💫 Hero.io — App Installation Manager

## 📋 Description
**Hero.io** is a modern React-based web application that allows users to explore, install, and manage applications locally.  
Installed apps are saved in the browser’s **LocalStorage**, so they remain available even after page refresh.  
Users can uninstall apps, sort them by popularity (downloads), and receive toast notifications for actions — all within a smooth, responsive UI.
